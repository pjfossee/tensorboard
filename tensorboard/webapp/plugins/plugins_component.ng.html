    <h3>No dashboards are active for the current data set.</h3>
    <p>Probable causes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You haven’t written any data to your event files.</li>
      <li>TensorBoard can’t find your event files.</li>
    </ul>

    If you’re new to using TensorBoard, and want to find out how to add data and
    set up your event files, check out the
    <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorboard/blob/master/README.md"
      >README</a
    >
    and perhaps the
    <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/summaries_and_tensorboard"
      >TensorBoard tutorial</a
    >.
    <p>
      If you think TensorBoard is configured properly, please see
      <a
        href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorboard/blob/master/README.md#my-tensorboard-isnt-showing-any-data-whats-wrong"
        >the section of the README devoted to missing data problems</a
      >
      and consider filing an issue on GitHub.
